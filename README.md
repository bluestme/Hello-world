Hello, this is Blue from the HK Polytechnic university as a biology student and an amateur programmer.
This repository is a collection of my personally written codes, some of them are class homeworks and some of them are just for my personal interests. These codes generally record my progress in programming since the first day I learn to program, that is 2019-01-03.
